         <p>Website is a hyper-media information storage system linking resources around the world. In website, browsers 
            allow highlighted words or an icon which is called hyper links to display text, video, graphics and sound on a 
            local computer screen. With the introduction of World Wide Web in 1989, the concept of websites has become more popular.
            On this web, anyone can create a home page, which millions of users can watch on their computers and respond.
            A website (also written as web site) is a collection of web pages and related content that is identified by a common 
            domain name and published on at least one web server. Notable examples are wikipedia.org, google.com, and amazon.com.
            All publicly accessible websites collectively constitute the World Wide Web. There are also private websites that can
            only be accessed on a private network, such as a company's internal website for its employees. Websites are typically 
            dedicated to a particular topic or purpose, such as news, education, commerce, entertainment, or social networking. 
            Hyperlinking between web pages guides the navigation of the site, which often starts with a home page.Users can access
            having a good website instantly boosts your credibility as a legitimate business. First impressions count, and websites 
            allow you to make a very strong impression with a well designed introduction for your business. A website can help showcase
            your expertise and better position your business, websites on a range of devices,including desktops, laptops, tablets, and smartphones.
            The app used on these devices is called a web browser. A website is a collection of related material that contains text, images, and may 
            also include video, audio or other media. A website can be as simple as a few static pages or as complex as several web applications running 
            simultaneously, and everything in between.A web page is often used to provide information to viewers, including pictures or videos to help illustrate
            important topics. A web page may also be used as a method to sell products or services to viewers. Multiple web pages make up a website, like our Computer Hope website.
